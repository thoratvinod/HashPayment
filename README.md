# HashPayment

We are looking forward to integrating payments for all our applications in the most generic way 

The application sends a request to the HashPayment Application by passing the Amount, Keys, Tenant Information, and Webhook URL on Successful or Failure

HashPayment stores and returns Unique Key, Redirect URL or process the payment 

The application always checks the status by sending the unique key to the HashPayment Application.

We are looking to integrate Stripe, Adyen
